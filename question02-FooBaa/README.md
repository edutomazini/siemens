<p>Consider the following problem:

<p>Write a C/C++ or Java program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.

For each multiple of 3, print "Foo" instead of the number.
For each multiple of 5, print "Baa" instead of the number.
For multiple numbers simultaneously of 3 and 5, print "FooBaa", instead of the number.

The ternary operator (?:) was used since we need to handle a simple condition.

Although it doesn't have a significant performance gain, it helps to simplify the code.

<p>Syntax

`condition ? value_if_true : value_if_falseË‹
